title: "Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers are Significantly Different"
mathjax: true

This summer, I've been interning as a machine learning engineer at Wish. At school, I do a lot of research on developing new machine learning algorithms and improving robustness especially when they are applied in the society. When I explain what I do to my friends outside ML, some of them respond to me saying "Oh! So you do data science." This is not quite right. I did explain to them how they differ, but since I've had this reaction more than three times, I decided to write a blog post, following the advice of a data scientist and a blogger I follow and respect.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When you’ve written the same code 3 times, write a function<br><br>When you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post</p>&mdash; David Robinson (@drob) <a href="https://twitter.com/drob/status/928447584712253440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2017</a></blockquote>

This post is will clarify the distinction between data science and machine learning engineering for you.
TL;DR is that **data scientists do science (understand things) whereas machine learning engineers do engineering (create things)**. Of course, there are many similarities too, that are usually the source of confusion. Hence, I'll emphasize the differences first, and then mention some similarities at the end.
