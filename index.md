I work at [Robust Intelligence](https://www.robustintelligence.com/), an AI security startup funded by Sequoia and Engineering Capital.  

<!-- My research is at the intersection of **machine learning and the social sciences**. I am attracted by the dynamic nature of social data and the algorithmic and statistical challenges it entails. The problems I engage with are of importance as we are increasingly using ML to improve decision-making in domains like business, politics and legal systems.  -->

## Previous Experience

I was a machine learning engineer at a **[$9B e-commerce with 300M users](https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2017/09/20/wish-8-billion-funding-amazon/)**, launched a Tokyo branch of a **[Harvard-MIT data consulting firm](http://www.quantco.com/)**, worked for **[the most active seed VC](https://east.vc/)** in south east Asia, and helped build a **[tool every Android developer uses](https://gradle.com/)**.

I graduated from Harvard College with a joint degree in computer science and statistics.
